no jquery 
decide on Uppercase lowercase on import
don't import something you will not use 
remove console.log that you don't need
you can add passport.authenticate as middleware
router.post("/login") why router.route("/login").post
register login differant page
authenticate user after register
product not article in link
should not choose the id
